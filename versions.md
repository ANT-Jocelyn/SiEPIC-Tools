# SiEPIC-Tools version history

v0.3.9
* moved missing Python libraries (requests, urllib3, certifi, chardet, idna) from Windows_Python_packages_for_KLayout to klayout folder, since OSX is also missing these libraries by default (though they can be easily installed with "pip").
* support for multiple technologies for INTERCONNECT CML library registration and simulations, for KLayout 0.24
