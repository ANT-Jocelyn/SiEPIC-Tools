Finding waveguides, devices, pins.  \r\n - Verification: Identifying if there are missing connections, mismatched waveguides, too few points in a bend, etc. \r\n - Example layouts using the library for verification (EBeam_LukasChrostowski_E_LVS.gds, SiEPIC_EBeam_PDK_Verification_Check.gds).\r\n- Circuit simulations:\r\n - Netlist generation\r\n - Creating a Spice netlist suitable for for circuit simulations. This includes extracting the waveguide length (wg_length) for all waveguides.\r\n - Menu item \"Lumerical INTERCONNECT\" will automatically: generate the netlist, launch Lumerical INTERCONNECT to perform the circuit simulations, and pop-up a plot of the transmission spectrum.\r\n- Waveguide functionality: \r\n - Menu item \"W\": selected paths are first snapped to the nearest pins, then converted to waveguides.\r\n - Menu item \"Shift-W\": selected waveguides are converted back to paths.\r\n- EBeam Layer definitions for KLayout (klayout_Layers_EBeam.lyp).\r\n- Monte Carlo simulations of waveguides.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Download and Installation instructions:\r\n - <a href=\"https://github.com/lukasc-ubc/SiEPIC_EBeam_PDK/wiki/Installation-instructions\">SiEPIC_EBeam_PDK download and installation instructions</a> on the wiki page.  \r\n\r\n\r\n##Contributing to this project:\r\n\r\nYou can download the latest development version (master) of the PDK: <a href=\"https://github.com/lukasc-ubc/SiEPIC_EBeam_PDK/archive/master.zip\">Zip file download of the PDK</a>\r\n\r\nIt is posted on GitHub for 1) revision control, 2) so that others can contribute to it, find bugs, 3) easy download of the latest version.\r\n\r\nTo contribute to the PDK:\r\n - On the GitHub web page, Fork a copy of the project into your own account.\r\n - Clone to your Desktop\r\n - Make edits/contributions.  You can use the KLayout IDE to write Python (or Ruby) scripts; <a href = http://www.klayout.de/doc/about/macro_editor.html>KLayout Python IDE for writing/debugging PCells/scripts/macros</a>.\r\n - \"Commit to master\" (your own master)\r\n - Create a <a href=\"https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/\">Pull Request</a> -- this will notify me of your contribution, which I can merge into the main project\r\n\r\nI am personally using <a href=\"https://desktop.github.com/\">GitHub desktop</a> to synchronize my files. Then I created symbolic links in my .klayout folder to point to the local copy of this repository. This is useful to automatically update my local KLayout installation (e.g., multiple computers), as changes are made in GitHub.\r\n\r\n##Screenshots:\r\n\r\n![Screenshot1](https://s3.amazonaws.com/edx-course-phot1x-chrostowski/PastedGraphic-9.png)\r\n![Screenshot2](https://s3.amazonaws.com/edx-course-phot1x-chrostowski/PastedGraphic-10.png)\r\n![Screenshot3](https://s3.amazonaws.com/edx-course-phot1x-chrostowski/KLayout_INTERCONNECT.png)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
